# Smart-dustbin-IOT

Hello Everywhere,

I am Chaithra L M. We were 5 in the team. and we created a smart dustbin using arduino uno using some IOT concepts.

what is a smart dustbin?
Smart Dustbin is just a normal bin where everyone can dispose waste but integration of some hardware components is done for more efficient use of it. Smart Dustbin is integrated with some hardware components such as Arduino, NODEMCU, Servo Motor, Ultrasonic sensors.

concepts used for creating a smart dustbin?
IoT and Networks

what are components requried?
Arduino UNO 
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Module.
TowerPro SG90 Servo Motor.
Connecting Wires.
5V Power Supply.
A small dustbin with hinged lid.
Miscellaneous (glue, plastic tube, etc.)

how does smart dustbin works:
The smart dustbin uses an Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to detect objects in front. It then sends the signals to Arduino Uno. The Arduino understands the signal and sends a signal to the Servomotor which opens the flap on top of the dustbin.

What are the Applications of smart dustbin?
1) To collect dustbins placed at public places in city. 
2) 2) Automatic open-close lid for ease of use 
3) 3) There is no contact touch between dustbin and Person so, prevention from germs and diseases. 
4) 4) Warning message indication when a Smart Trash Bin is nearly full. Also send SMS to garbage collector in particular area.
